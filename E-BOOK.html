 <h2 id="t1">ALL ABOUT LOVE</h2>
 <pre>
 We're taught to think of love as something that happens to us. It's a magical but altogether passive experience. 
 In her deeply personal and emphatic All About Love, renowned social activist and feminist bell hooks asserts that,
 in fact, love is a choice we must all make and it's not nearly as abstract or elusive as many of us have come to believe. 
 The book not only explores the role of love in our lives and the ways our culture has distorted its meaning, 
 but guides us — with clear definitions and examples — toward a better understanding of how to cultivate it.

<h2 id="t2">2666</h2>
 <pre>
  It's an entire world unto itself, one — not unlike our own — filled with horror, neglect, depravity, brilliance, and beauty. 
  Epic in scope and epitomizing the "total novel," 2666 fuses many different genres and styles to create a singular and unforgettable 
  work of contemporary fiction. While Bolaño's swan song marked the pinnacle of a sadly truncated literary career, his immense talent, creativity, and vision endure.

<h2 id="t3">DESERT'S SOLTAIRE</h2>
 <pre>
 Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness — now nearly a half-century old — is a classic of environmental writing. In this autobiographical work,
 Abbey chronicles his time as a park ranger and reflects on landscape, culture, politics, tourism, environmental disregard, and degradation — doing so with
 a unique blend of ornery charm and breathtaking description.

<h2 id="t4">GIOVANNI'S ROOM</h2>
 <pre>
 It would be difficult to talk about James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room and not touch on the simple fact that this slim novel, published in 1956, is mainly a love story between two men.
 It seems impossible to think such a thing could be published pre-Stonewall, but such is the genius of Baldwin and the way he captures the complexities of desire, love, and the 
 tragic cost that comes from not following your heart. "Somebody…should have told us that not many people have ever died of love. But multitudes have perished…for the lack of it."

<h2 id="t5">THE HANDMAID'S TALE</h2>
 <pre>
 The Handmaid's Tale is ultimately a hopeful book — Offred, and others, simply cannot be human without the possibility of hope, and therein lies the strength of the resistance. 
 All of Atwood is worth reading, but this book best exemplifies the cultural and psychological impact that a work of fiction can create.The novel is as relevant today as ever; 
 feminist backlashes continue to wax and wane, but women's rights remain in the spotlight.
